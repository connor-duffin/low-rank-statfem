# statBZ

Statistical finite elements for reaction diffusion problems. Requires `fenics`
and `pytest`.

## On the name

This project started as a case-study into the BZ reaction but as time evolved we
began to look into different reaction-diffusion systems. Due to laziness (and
quite liking the abbreviation) this package is called `statbz`.
